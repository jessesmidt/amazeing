# You will implement a maze generator in Python that takes a configuration file, generates a
# maze, eventually perfect (with a single path between entrance and exit), and writes it to a
# file using a hexadecimal wall representation. You will also provide a visual representation
# of the maze and organize your code so that the generation logic can be reused later.

# Your program must be run with the following command:
# python3 a_maze_ing.py config.txt
# • a_maze_ing.py is your main program file. You must use this name.
# • config.txt is the only argument. It is a plain text file that defines the maze
# generation options. You can use a different filename.
# Your program must handle all errors gracefully: invalid configuration, file not found, bad
# syntax, impossible maze parameters, etc. It must never crash unexpectedly, and must
# always provide a clear error message to the user.
